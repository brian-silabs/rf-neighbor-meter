/** @brief Incoming Packet Filter
 *
 * NOTE: REQUIRES INCLUDING THE PACKET-HANDOFF PLUGIN. This is called by the
 * Packet Handoff plugin when the stack receives a packet from one of the
 * protocol layers specified in ::EmberZigbeePacketType. The packetType argument
 * is one of the values of the ::EmberZigbeePacketType enum. If the stack
 * receives an 802.15.4 MAC beacon, it will call this function with the
 * packetType argument set to ::EMBER_ZIGBEE_PACKET_TYPE_BEACON. The
 * implementation of this callback may alter the data contained in packetData,
 * modify options and flags in the auxillary data, or consume the packet itself,
 * either sending the message, or discarding it as it sees fit.
 *
 * @param packetType the type of packet and associated protocol layer  Ver.:
 * always
 * @param packetData flat buffer containing the packet data associated with the
 * packet type  Ver.: always
 * @param size_p a pointer containing the size value of the packet  Ver.: always
 * @param data auxillary data included with the packet  Ver.: always
